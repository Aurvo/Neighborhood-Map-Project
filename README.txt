RUNNING AND USING THE APP:

Run the app by simply opening app.html in your favorite browser.

-Add markers to certain locations by clicking at them.
-Clicking a marker shows shows information about the surrounding area and allows you to rename
or delete it.
-You can get easy access to all the map's markers through the menu on the left. You can filter
the markers that appear there and on the map with the search box at the top.
-The app stores your marker data in local storage and loads that data during initialization.

I used JavaScript, CSS, and HTML references from W3Schools for looking up
specific JavaScript Functions, specific CSS styles and selectors, and for the hamburger
icon.

I used this StackOverflow post for help when trying to get my app to apply Knockout bindings
to a google maps infoWindow right after it opened.
